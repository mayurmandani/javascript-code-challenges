/* 
A Generator function in JavaScript is a special type of function that can be paused and resumed during its execution.
When a generator function called it returns a generator object that can be used to control the execution of the function by calling the next() method.
The functionâ€™s code can be paused within the body using the yield keyword, and it can later be resumed from the exact point where it was paused.
